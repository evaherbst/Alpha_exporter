# Alpha_graphs

Written by Eva C. Herbst

Matlab to graph and export alpha shapes from joint range of motion data, as part of our paper on using alpha shapes along with digital marionettes in Maya to investigate limb configurations.

The code enabels plotting of mobility data (as Euler angles) and creation of alpha shapes from these points. A color-blind friendly palette is used for plotting.

An example from Herbst et al. 2022:



Inputs: .csv file with Euler rotations as columns
Outputs: Matlab figure, .obj of alpha shape
